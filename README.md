Introduction Name: Daffa Ilham Altaffitri
## Problem Statements, Objectives, and Goals
Hello, my name is Daffa, and I have recently joined SegerWaras.co, a leading health-tech company, as a Data Scientist. My inaugural project involves analyzing text data provided by our team of psychologists and psychiatrists. This dataset comprises chat messages from our customers, which contain rich insights into their emotional states and mental health concerns.

The primary objective of this project is to develop an NLP (Natural Language Processing) analysis system capable of classifying these chat messages into categories such as sadness, joy, love, etc. This classification will enable our mental health professionals to better understand the prevailing emotional states of our users, thereby assisting in diagnosis, treatment planning, and tailoring their interactions to meet the users' specific needs more effectively.
